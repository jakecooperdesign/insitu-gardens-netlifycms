## where landscape meets art

InSitu is an eight-acre sculpture garden designed to be spiritually and emotionally inspiring. The landscape combines structures, rich plantings, and art. 

For nearly two decades InSitu has been a collaborative space between landscape designers, artists, and its owner and creative director.  An outdoor sketchbook featuring terraces, portals, arbors, walls, water features, and many hidden seasonal gems.

InSitu is closed to the public, if you would like to schedule a tour or are interested in more information please contact us at <a class="text-green-800 font-medium underline" href="info@insitugardens.com">info@insitugardens.com</a>
