## where nature and art interact  |  InSitu

InSitu is an eight acre sculpture garden where nature and art dramatically interact. Collaborating with the talents of architects, landscapers, craftsmen and artists, owner Michael Marocco has created a richly composed showcase of horticulture and sculpture, seamlessly woven together in a series of twenty garden “rooms.”

These individually designed venues include native meadows, deciduous trees, flowering plants, architectural arbors, water features, and terraces, all connected by grass, stone, and woodland walkways. Sculpture from the eclectic collection representing both American and International artists is placed in each garden space to create a distinctive focal point. Near the house, formal elements offer a place from which to observe the surrounding landscape.

InSitu was designed by Richard Hartlage, founder of Land Morphology, Seattle, WA. The extensive stonework throughout was executed by Redding-based stone artisans the Pilato Brothers. The property is meticulously cared for by John Kuczo of Kuczo Tree and Lawn Care in Wilton, CT. 

InSitu has been featured in numerous publications and is included in the National Garden Conservancy's 40th anniversary book, *Outstanding American Gardens: A Celebration*.

InSitu is closed to the public, if you would like to schedule a tour or are interested in more information please contact us at <a class="text-green-800 font-medium underline" href="info@insitugardens.com">info@insitugardens.com</a>
