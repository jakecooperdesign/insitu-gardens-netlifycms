## where landscape meets art

InSitu is an eight-acre sculpture garden designed to be spiritually and emotionally inspiring. The landscape combines structures, rich plantings, and art. 

For nearly two decades InSitu has been a collaborative space between landscape designers, artists, and its owner and creative director.  An outdoor sketchbook featuring terraces, portals, arbors, walls, water features, and many hidden seasonal gems.
