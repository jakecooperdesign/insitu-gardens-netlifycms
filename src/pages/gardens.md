Built into several Garden Rooms, InSitu explores a unique approach by layering textures of vibrant plantings, sculptures and stonework. 

Each room features a sculptural and botanic theme meant to engage each other while simultaneously feeling organic and peaceful.  Colossal stone structures make way for breezy fields of tall grass and whimsical sculptures.
