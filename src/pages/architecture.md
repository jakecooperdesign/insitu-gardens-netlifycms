    InSitu explores the limitless bounds between art, nature, and the
    experiential.


    Beginning as untamed wilderness 18 years ago, InSitu has been a
    collaborative sketchbook between landscape architects, artists, designers,
    and its owner and creative director. Set in the heart of Redding,
    Connecticut, the estate celebrates the best of New England flora; native
    grasses and perennials, fields flooded with Goldenrod, granite and bluestone
    from local quarries all come together as the local vernacular to create a
    spiritual oasis.
